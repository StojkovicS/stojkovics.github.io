    "text": "In this project, I examine the relationship between a country’s reserve holdings and its external debt using the World Bank’s International Debt Statistics. Specifically, I analyze the “Total reserves (% of total external debt)” indicator, which expresses a nation’s assets (foreign exchange and gold) as a percentage of its total external liabilities. This ratio offers a measure of external‑debt servicing capacity:\nHigh values indicate ample reserves relative to debt, signaling strong repayment ability and a buffer against external shocks. Low values suggest limited reserves, raising the risk of higher borrowing costs, rollover difficulties, or dependence on external assistance.\nBy comparing this ratio across developing economies, the project aims to identify patterns of fiscal resilience and vulnerability.\nI used SQL to filter data and extract key insights from the World Bank database. For more details, you can check out the complete code and dataset on my GitHub repository).\n\n\n\n\nTable 1 presents the five developing countries with the highest and lowest reserves‑to‑debt ratios for 2023. Algeria (930%) and Iraq (520%) lead the list, indicating that Algeria’s reserves exceed its external debt by more than nine‑fold, and Iraq’s by over five‑fold. China also ranks among the top, with reserves covering 142.5% of its external debt—enough to fully repay its obligations and still have 42.5% left over. By contrast, Zimbabwe’s ratio is under 1%, meaning its reserves cover less than 1% of its external debt.\nHaving very low reserves-to-debt ratio carries significant risks. Such countries may struggle to roll over maturing obligations or defend their currency during capital outflows, which can trigger higher borrowing costs, currency crises, or the need for emergency external assistance.\nConversely, an excessively large buffer of reserves relative to debt is not necessarily a positive sign, at least not without reservations. While it does imply strong external liquidity, minimal rollover risk, and ample shock absorption capacity, it can also signal (1) under-investment, i.e., large passive reserves may reflect the lack of productive public investment in infrastructure, education, or health, for whatever reason, and (2) commodity Dependence - if reserves come primarily from volatile resource exports (e.g., diamonds in Botswana or oil in Gulf states), a price slump can rapidly erode such buffers.\nTable 2 illustrates how this played out in Botswana during the 2008–09 global financial crisis. Diamonds—accounting for 70–80% of Botswana’s export earnings—saw prices plunge by over 30%, collapsing global demand for luxury goods and triggering a dramatic drop in the reserves‑to‑debt ratio of the country in 2009. This episode underscores the risk of building reserves on a narrow, volatile base: a sudden commodity shock can rapidly deplete buffers. By contrast, China’s reserves‑to‑debt ratio has remained relatively stable throughout the years—neither excessively high nor too low—suggesting a more diversified mix of export‑driven inflows, natural resources and likely a solid reserve management. Such a profile suggests greater structural resilience against external shocks.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, Table 3 presents the “Total reserves (% of total external debt)” for available European countries, showing both the latest available year (2003) and the 2007–2023 average. Bosnia and Herzegovina tops the list, with reserves covering a substantial share of its external debt. Moreover, the average figures show that the top five countries converge around a ratio of ~40%, indicating that on average their reserves could cover roughly 40% of external liabilities. By contrast, Ukraine, Belarus, and Montenegro average only about 20% (or less), signaling greater vulnerability in meeting external obligations.\nThese comparisons highlight how different economies vary in their external‑debt buffers—some maintain moderate resilience, while others remain at higher risk of liquidity shortfalls."

By leveraging daily price data from Yahoo Finance and Python libraries, I compute key performance metrics (CAGR and Sharpe ratio) before constructing the efficient frontier to find the portfolios that minimize risk and maximize risk‑adjusted return.\nSee the full code and dataset in my GitHub repository.\n\n\n\nStarting with a simple 20% allocation to each FAANG stock, I transform daily closing prices into portfolio returns and extract two core metrics:\n\nCompound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR): I compound every trading-day return over the four-year span, then take the four-year root to annualize. Outcome: ~20% per year, meaning the portfolio would have grown by that average rate if gains were reinvested.\nAnnualized Sharpe Ratio: I divide the mean daily return by its daily volatility and scale by √252 to annualize. Outcome of ~0.72 indicates the portfolio earned 0.72 units of excess return for each unit of annual risk. E.g. a 10% yearly volatility would translate into approximately 7.2% excess return.\n\nThese figures provide a baseline for optimizing portfolio weights.\n\n\n\nI then plot the efficient frontier (EF), which maps the highest possible expected return for any given level of annualized volatility. The EF is shown in Figure 2.\nThe X axis represents annualized volatility (risk). This measures how uncertain the returns are. The farther right one goes, the more risk one is taking on. The Y axis represents annualized expected return. This is the average payoff per year. The higher up one goes, the more return can be expected.\n\nEach black dot marks a single FAANG stock’s volatility and return. The blue curve shows the frontier of efficient portfolios—those that deliver maximum return for their risk level.\nOnce the EF has been calculated, I can now point to two types of optimal portfolios composed of FAANG stocks."

This analysis yields an outcome of 0.0937, meaning that on an average trading day, such portfolio returned roughly +0.0937%.\nIn addition, to get annualized return of such portfolio, I take each day’s percentage change in portfolio value, compound them to get the total multi-year return, and then take the Y-year root.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Sharpe ratio is the excess return an investor earns per unit of risk (where “risk” is measured as the standard deviation of returns). For simplicity, I assume risk-free rate of 0 for this case, so will be just mean portfolio return divided by its volatility. A Sharpe ratio matters because it lets us compare strategies of different risk profiles on a level playing field.\nIn general, this is the rule of thumb of interpreting Sharpe ratio:\n&lt; 1.0 modest - the strategy has positive reward but one is taking risk that yields less than a one-to-one payoff.\n1.0–1.5 good.\nabove 1.5 very strong.\nTo calculate the Sharpe ratio, I use previously computed daily returns, then calculate daily volatility, i.e., standard deviation of daily returns. Finally, I annualize it by using: daily_sharpe * np.sqrt(252)\nThis results in 0.72, meaning that on average, the portfolio delivered 0.72% annual return for each 1% of annual volatility. For instance: If your portfolio’s yearly standard deviation (its “bounciness”) was 10%, then at a Sharpe of 0.72 it would have delivered about 0.72×10%=7.2% of return above cash (in excess of what you’d earn by holding cash) over that year.\n\n\nIn the next two steps, I derive a portfolio with minimum risk and maximum Sharpe from the FAANG universe. I do this by calculating the efficient frontier, i.e., the set of “best of the best” curve of all possible portfolios one can build from FAANG stocks.\nThe efficient frontier is shown in Figure 2. X axis represents annualized volatility (risk) is on the X-axis. This measures how uncertain the returns are. The farther right one goes, the more risk one is taking on. Y axis represents annualized expected return. This is the average payoff per year. The higher up one goes, the more return can be expected.\n\nFurthermore, each of the five FAANG tickers (AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, META, NFLX) is plotted as a single black dot. Finally, the blue curved line is the efficient frontier: the set of all portfolios (different weightings of the five stocks) that maximize return for a given level of risk, or equivalently minimize risk for a given level of return. Each point on that smooth line corresponds to one specific vector of weights (e.g. 12% AAPL, 8% AMZN, 25% GOOGL, …). Thus, any portfolio on the curve is considered efficient — no other combination of these stocks can give more return without also taking on more risk. For instance, if one wanted a portfolio at, say, 20% volatility, they’d pick the point on the curve at x=0.20, and there’s a unique weight vector for that. Stocks that lie far below the frontier are the ones we’d tend to give lower weight in the optimal blends.\n\nThe minimum volatility star: marks the portfolio on the efficient frontier with the lowest possible risk. Put another way, if an investor is super‑conservative, this is the blend of FAANG stocks that historically has the smallest ups‑and‑downs in return\nThe minimum volatility star: maximizes the Sharpe ratio, which is divided by volatility. In this case, it is simply highest return per unit of risk.\n\nIf one only picked single stocks, they’d be on one of the black dots. If one diversified smartly among FAANG, they’d lie somewhere along that blue curve"

So the optimizer sees META either as too volatile or too correlated (or both) with the others, so it drops it entirely. Similarly, Netflix also has relatively high volatility/correlation, so it only gets a small portion into the min-vol portfolio.\nThus, for instance, the analysis suggests no allocation into META and nearly 40% of portfolio to be invested in AAPL. Such portfolio would have 30.3% annual volatility which means that in a “typical” year your portfolio’s return would swing about ±30% around its average return. This is an above average volatility (S&P 500 moves ±15-20% a year), but within a FAANG-only universe it’s the lowest-risk mix one can build given the return and covariance estimates."

This is an above average volatility (S&P 500 moves ±15-20% a year), but within a FAANG-only universe it’s the lowest-risk mix one can build given the return and covariance estimates."

    "text": "In this section I derive a portfolio with minimum risk and maximum Sharpe from the FAANG universe. I do this by calculating the efficient frontier, i.e., the set of “best of the best” curve of all possible portfolios one can build from FAANG stocks.\nThe efficient frontier is shown in Figure 2. X axis represents annualized volatility (risk) is on the X-axis. This measures how uncertain the returns are. The farther right one goes, the more risk one is taking on. Y axis represents annualized expected return. This is the average payoff per year. The higher up one goes, the more return can be expected.\n\nFurthermore, each of the five FAANG tickers (AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, META, NFLX) is plotted as a single black dot. Finally, the blue curved line is the efficient frontier: the set of all portfolios (different weightings of the five stocks) that maximize return for a given level of risk, or equivalently minimize risk for a given level of return. Each point on that smooth line corresponds to one specific vector of weights (e.g. 12% AAPL, 8% AMZN, 25% GOOGL, …). Thus, any portfolio on the curve is considered efficient — no other combination of these stocks can give more return without also taking on more risk. For instance, if one wanted a portfolio at, say, 20% volatility, they’d pick the point on the curve at x=0.20, and there’s a unique weight vector for that. Stocks that lie far below the frontier are the ones we’d tend to give lower weight in the optimal blends.\n\nThe minimum volatility star: marks the portfolio on the efficient frontier with the lowest possible risk. Put another way, if an investor is super‑conservative, this is the blend of FAANG stocks that historically has the smallest ups‑and‑downs in return\nThe minimum volatility star: maximizes the Sharpe ratio, which is divided by volatility. In this case, it is simply highest return per unit of risk.\n\nIf one only picked single stocks, they’d be on one of the black dots. If one diversified smartly among FAANG, they’d lie somewhere along that blue curve\n\n\nThe set of portfolio weights that minimizes the overall portfolio volatility:\nAAPL: 39.8% AMZN: 14.9% GOOGL: 38.3% META: 0.0% NFLX: 6.96%\nVolatility analysis is based on covariance matrix. So the optimizer sees META either as too volatile or too correlated (or both) with the others, so it drops it entirely. Similarly, Netflix also has relatively high volatility, so it only gets a small portion into the min-vol portfolio. Thus, for instance, the analysis suggests no allocation into META and nearly 40% of portfolio to be invested in AAPL.\nAdditionally, such portfolio would have 30.3% annual volatility which means that in a “typical” year the portfolio’s return would swing about ±30% around its average return. This is an above average volatility (S&P 500 moves ±15-20% a year), but within a FAANG-only universe it’s the lowest-risk mix one can build given the return and covariance estimates.\n\n\n\nWhat portfolio of FAANG stocks would offer the most attractive trade-off of extra return per unit of risk? These are the weights if the max-Sharpe portfolio star from Figure 1:\nAAPL 78.74% AMZN 0.00% GOOGL 19.97% META 0.00% NFLX 1.29%\nNearly 80% in Apple and 20.0% in Google, plus a tiny 1.3% in Netflix.

Looking at the table of Sharpe values, such portfolio would yield less then one-to-one payoff which is not ideal but understandable given that the universe contains only tech-heavy stocks.\n\n\n\nHow did the same stocks reacted to Trump’s “liberation day”? To capture performance of stocks before and this date, I plot the FAANG stocks between April 30, 2024 and April 30 2025. The vertical line is Trump’s introduction of tariffs.\n\nAs the Figure 3 shows, Netflix and Meta were hit hard by the introduction of tariffs. However, their post-tariff movement is different. Netflix bounced back end even outperformed in the month following the tariffs, while Meta remained under its pre-tariff levels.\nThe other three FAANG stocks were all somewhat down after the tariffs but remained steady in the following after the initial decline."
