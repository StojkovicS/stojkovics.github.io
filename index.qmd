### About Me
Hi, I’m Stefan.
I translate complex datasets into actionable insights using R, SQL, and Python. I studied in the Netherlands and Hungary, lived and worked in Serbia, and now I’m based in Germany, where I’m building my career as a data professional. Currently, I contribute to a European Research Council‑funded project (until September 30, 2025) helping policy teams anticipate political risks across Europe.

### What I bring
- 4 years of expertise in research design, statistical modeling, visualization and data-driven consulting
- Bridging quantitative analytics with human‑behavior insights
- Building predictive models and streamlining workflows  
- Communicating data‑driven strategies to boost project efficiency 

**Outside of work**, I like to talk about financial markets, politics and basketball.
