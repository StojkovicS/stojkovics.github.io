### About Me

Hi, I’m Stefan. I translate complex datasets into actionable recommendations using R, SQL, and Python. I studied in the Netherlands and Hungary, lived and worked in Serbia, and now I’m based in Germany, where I’m building my career as a data professional. Currently, I am contributing to a 1.5 Million EUR worth European Research Council‑funded project (until September 30, 2025) helping policy teams anticipate political risks across Europe.

### What I bring

-   Advanced analytically expertise: four years designing research studies, building statistical models and visualizations.
-   Project management: Proven ability to manage teams, streamline workflows, and deliver data-driven solutions.
-   Human-Centered Insights: Skilled at bridging quantitative analytics with behavioral context to translate numbers into narratives that drive strategic decisions.
-   Communication: Experienced in crafting data-backed strategies that align with project goals and foster buy-in across diverse audiences.

**Outside of work**, I like to talk about financial markets, politics and basketball.
