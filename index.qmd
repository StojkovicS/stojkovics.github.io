### About Me

Hi, I’m Stefan. I turn messy political, economic and financial data into reproducible analyses and actionable recommendations using R, Python and SQL. I studied in the Netherlands and Hungary, worked in Serbia, and am based in Germany. I currently contribute to a European Research Council-funded research project on political risk (contract through Jan 30, 2026).

My focus: reproducible workflows, causal & predictive analysis, and clear stakeholder communication. I target roles in data science, policy analytics, or quantitative risk analysis.

### What I bring

- KPI-driven mindset: 4+ years designing studies, feature engineering and translating results into operational recommendations.

- Reproducible workflows: R/Python pipelines, documented scripts, notebooks, and Shiny apps for standardized data collection.

- Technical stack: R (tidyverse, shiny), Python (pandas, sklearn), SQL, GitHub; Microsoft Azure and GenAI fundamentals, familiar with PyTorch & Hugging Face.

- Project management & mentoring: led small research teams and trained research assistants to reproducible practices.

**Outside of work**, I like to talk about financial markets, politics and basketball.
