### About Me

Hi, I’m Stefan. I translate complex data into actionable recommendations using R, SQL, and Python. I studied in the Netherlands and Hungary, lived and worked in Serbia, and now I’m based in Germany, where I’m building my career as a data professional. Currently, I am contributing to a 1.5 Million EUR worth European Research Council‑funded project (until September 30, 2025) helping policy teams anticipate political risks across Europe.

### What I bring

- KPI-driven mindset: four years of experience designing research and translating insights into impactful outcomes.
- Strong skills in data analysis, interpretation and visualization.
- Project management: experience managing research projects and mentoring team member.
- Excellent interpersonal skills and the ability to present to different audiences.

**Outside of work**, I like to talk about financial markets, politics and basketball.
