### About Me

Hi, I’m Stefan. I turn messy political, economic and financial data into reproducible analyses and actionable recommendations using R, Python and SQL. I trained in psychology and political & economic sciences (Netherlands, Hungary), have worked in Serbia, and am now based in North Rhine–Westphalia, Germany.

I focus on reproducible workflows, causal and predictive analysis, and clear stakeholder communication: designing robust studies, engineering and transforming features for reliable models, and translating results into concise recommendations decision-makers can act on.

I currently contribute to a European Research Council–funded project on political risk assessment across Europe (contract through January 30, 2026). I also maintain several side projects.

### What I bring

-   Domain knowledge in political and social science combined with applied data science.

-   Hands-on experience engineering and transforming features to build reliable models (statistical & ML) and for validation.

-   Reproducible, collaborative analysis pipelines (R / Python / SQL)

-   Proven ability to lead small teams, manage analytic projects, and translate findings clearly to decision-makers.

**Outside of work**, I like to talk about basketball, financial markets and politics.
